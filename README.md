# EECE655_Group6

- The blind tcp reset attacks aims to reset a connection between two hosts by sending to on of the hosts a packet with the RST flag on.
- The host is forced to abort connection because of the nature of how the RST flag works
- We are assuming that the hosts are present on the same network as the attacker, which enables the attacker to sniff the needed information to perform the attack.
- We included screanshots and a .pcapng file of the attack conducted between two hosts communicating through telnet.
